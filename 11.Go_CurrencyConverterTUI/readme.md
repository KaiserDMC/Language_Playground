# Currency Converter TUI

## Overview

The Currency Converter TUI is a terminal-based application built in Go that fetches real-time exchange rates, saves them locally, and allows users to convert an amount of money from one currency to another. The app features a user-friendly text-based interface, utilizing the tool from `charmbracelet`, such as `bubbletea`, `huh` and `lipgloss` libraries for building modern, interactive TUI (Text User Interface) applications. This tool is designed for learning purposes, but it also provides a quick and efficient currency conversion directly from the terminal.

## Features

- **Fetch Real-Time Exchange Rates:** The app fetches the latest exchange rates from a public API and saves them locally in a JSON file for offline use.
